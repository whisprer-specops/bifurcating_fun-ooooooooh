# bifurcating_fun-ooooooooh

this is a collection of my coding experiments following discovering the math for uncontrollably bifurcating code. it involves a variety of dif project ideas, none of which is developed, but all can be seebn quite cleasrly where they were  leading... for a rainy day perhaps?

so, the rainy day finally came.

and to my surprise the star of the show? the version of the code that generates audio signals as bifurcating pitch output! oh what wonderous amazingly electronic, dubsteppy growling and wailing synth noises come out of this thing. and i have a collection of the .wavs it produced kept as samples to use in ableton. : D

it's a lil finnicky at first not to get pure white noise out of it but with some iterating through to find just the right balance of settings... welp, the results speak for themselves!
